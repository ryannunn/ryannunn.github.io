						<h2><strong>About Ryan</strong></h2>
						<p>Ryan was born and raised in Southeastern Pennsylvania. </p><p>As a boy, he was only allowed to watch TV on Saturday mornings, so he used to set an alarm for 4am, and head down to watch eight uninterrupted hours of infomercials and cartoons.</p><p>It is a credible belief that several hours of weight loss supplement ads and Pok&eacute;mon reruns stunted his tiny developing brain, leaving him the way he is today.</p><p>Presently, Ryan doesn't own a television, and only wakes up at 4am when there's an earthquake. He feels very fortunate to spend most of his time in beautiful Los Angeles where 35% of his annual income goes toward sunscreen.</p><p>A comedian, actor, and improviser, Ryan embodies the classic triple threat to move back in with his parents.</p>
